ClockstaRG-package      ClockstaRG: An implementation of ClockstaR for
                        genomic data
boot.clara              boot.clara performs a parametric bootstrap of
                        the sBSDmin distances among trees. For every
                        bootstrap replicate it calculates the cluster
                        width (Wk) or the silhouette width (Sk),
                        depending on whether run.clara.sk, or
                        run.clara.sil is used. See the tutorial for
                        details and instructions.
fill.matrix             fill.matirx fills the NA values in the pairwise
                        sBSDmin matrix obtained with fold.sbsd
fold.sbsd               fold.sbsd formats the sBSDmin distances
                        calculated with get.sbsd to be used in
                        clustering algorithms.
get.gap                 Get gap statistic.
get.sbsd                get.sbsd calculates the sBSDmin distance for
                        pairs of trees. It is similar to the function
                        bsd.dist in ClockstaR2, but it can handle data
                        sets with many trees.
make.tree.comps         This function creates a file with the names of
                        the pairwise comparissons for all trees.
optim.trees.g           optim.trees.g is can be used to optimise the
                        branch lengths for a tree topology over many
                        alignments. Please see the tutorial for
                        instructions to use.
run.clara.sil           run.clara is used to run the CLARA algorithm
                        from package 'cluster'. For values of 'k' from
                        2:N, it estimates the average silhouette width.
run.clara.wk            run.clara is used to run the CLARA algorithm on
                        the MDS of the sBSDmin distances for pairs of
                        trees. For every value of 'k' it estimates the
                        cluster width, 'Wk'.
run.mds                 run.mds obtains a multidimensional scaling
                        (MDS) of the pariwise sBSDmin distances between
                        trees.
