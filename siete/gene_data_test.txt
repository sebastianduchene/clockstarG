gene4,9162,<Entrezgene_type value="protein-coding">6,Homo sapiens,DGKI,diacylglycerol kinase, iota,chromosome 7 alternate HuRef,This gene is a member of the type IV diacylglycerol kinase subfamily.  Diacylglycerol kinases regulate the intracellular concentration of diacylglycerol through its phosphorylation, producing phosphatidic acid.  The specific role of the enzyme encoded by this gene is undetermined, however, it may play a crucial role in the production of phosphatidic acid in the retina or in recessive forms of retinal degeneration.

gene5,2033,<Entrezgene_type value="protein-coding">6,Homo sapiens,EP300,E1A binding protein p300,chromosome 22 alternate HuRef,RSTS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. RSTS typically occurs as the result of a de novo mutation in the family; most individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., the only affected member in a family). In most instances, the parents of an individual with RSTS are not affected. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the empiric recurrence risk for sibs is approximately 0.1%. Individuals with RSTS rarely reproduce. The theoretical risk to offspring is 50%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation or deletion in the family is known.

gene10,10020,<Entrezgene_type value="protein-coding">6,Homo sapiens,GNE,glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase,chromosome 9 alternate HuRef,The diagnosis of GNE-related myopathy is based on clinical and histopathologic criteria. Because simplex cases (i.e. a single occurrence in a family) are common, the presence of affected relatives is not obligatory for the diagnosis. Muscle histopathology typically shows rimmed vacuoles and characteristic filamentous inclusions. GNE, which encodes the bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, is the only gene in which mutations are known to cause GNE-related myopathy.

gene14,9583,<Entrezgene_type value="protein-coding">6,Homo sapiens,ENTPD4,ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 4,chromosome 8 alternate HuRef,This gene encodes a member of the apyrase protein family. Apyrases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleotide diphosphates and triphosphates in a calcium or magnesium-dependent manner. The encoded protein is an endo-apyrase and may play a role in salvaging nucleotides from lysosomes. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, and these isoforms may differ in divalent cation dependence and substrate specificity.

At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known.
