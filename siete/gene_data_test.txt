The encoded protein plays a role in cell adhesion, motility and proliferation, and is a critical mediator of apoptotic cell phagocytosis as well as amyloid-beta peptide uptake in the brain. Expression of this gene may be associated with schizophrenia, and mutations in this gene are a cause of early-onset myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia (EMARDD) as well as congenital myopathy with minicores. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2012]
gene82,8546,<Entrezgene_type value="protein-coding">6,Homo sapiens,AP3B1,adaptor-related protein complex 3, beta 1 subunit,chromosome 5 alternate HuRef,Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a multisystem disorder characterized by: tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism; a bleeding diathesis resulting from a platelet storage pool deficiency; and, in some cases, pulmonary fibrosis or granulomatous colitis. The albinism is characterized by: hypopigmentation of the skin and hair; and ocular findings of reduced iris pigment with iris transillumination, reduced retinal pigment, foveal hypoplasia with significant reduction in visual acuity (usually in the range of 20/50 to 20/400), nystagmus, and increased crossing of the optic nerve fibers. Hair color ranges from white to brown; skin color ranges from white to olive and is usually a shade lighter than that of other family members. The bleeding diathesis can result in easy bruising, frequent epistaxis, gingival bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, colonic bleeding, and prolonged bleeding with menses or after tooth extraction, circumcision, and other surgeries. Pulmonary fibrosis, a restrictive lung disease, typically causes symptoms in the early thirties and can progress to death within a decade. Granulomatous colitis is severe in about 15% of affected individuals.

gene84,33530,<Entrezgene_type value="protein-coding">6,Drosophila melanogaster,gkt,glaikit,chromosome 14 alternate HuRef,The protein encoded by this gene is involved in repairing stalled topoisomerase I-DNA complexes by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond between the tyrosine residue of topoisomerase I and the 3-prime phosphate of DNA. This protein may also remove glycolate from single-stranded DNA containing 3-prime phosphoglycolate, suggesting a role in repair of free-radical mediated DNA double-strand breaks. This gene is a member of the phospholipase D family and contains two PLD phosphodiesterase domains. Mutations in this gene are associated with the disease spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1). While several transcript variants may exist for this gene, the full-length natures of only two have been described to date. These two represent the major variants of this gene and encode the same isoform. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

The parents of an affected child are obligate heterozygotes and thus carry one mutant allele. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. There is an increased chance for miscarriages and second- and third-trimester fetal loss of affected fetuses. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutations in the family are known.

It encodes a member of the DOCK (dedicator of cytokinesis) family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein, dedicator of cytokinesis 3 (DOCK3), is also known as modifier of cell adhesion (MOCA) and presenilin-binding protein (PBP). The DOCK3 and DOCK1, -2 and -4 share several conserved amino acids in their DHR-2 (DOCK homology region 2) domains that are required for GEF activity, and bind directly to WAVE proteins [Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family Verprolin-homologous proteins] via their DHR-1 domains. The DOCK3 induces axonal outgrowth in CNS by stimulating membrane recruitment of the WAVE complex and activating the small G protein Rac1. This gene is associated with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like phenotype by a complex chromosomal rearrangement. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010]
